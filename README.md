[Hacking with SwiftUI: 100 days challenge](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui)

Project 2:
Guess the flag: A game of matching the right country to the right flag

# How the game works:

The game is a small quiz of 8 questions, for each question you have to find the right flag for a given country.
You have a score that tracks whether you answered well or not.
After you answered the 8 questions, you get a final score and can try again.
